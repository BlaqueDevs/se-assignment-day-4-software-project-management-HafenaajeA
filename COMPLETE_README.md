## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

--> Defining the project scope is essential for successful project planning as it sets clear boundaries, objectives, and deliverables. It helps prevent scope creep, ensures efficient resource allocation, improves risk management, and aligns stakeholder expectations. A well-defined scope keeps the project on track and within budget.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical breakdown of the project's total work into smaller, manageable tasks. It helps in organizing and structuring the project by dividing it into phases, deliverables, and work packages. WBS is useful because it improves planning, enhances task delegation, simplifies cost estimation, and makes tracking progress more manageable. It ensures that every part of the project is accounted for and executed systematically.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

--> Developing a detailed project schedule provides several benefits, including improved time management, better resource allocation, and enhanced coordination among team members. It helps set clear deadlines, track progress, identify potential delays early, and ensure the project stays on course. A well-structured schedule also enhances accountability and efficiency, reducing the risk of missed milestones.

--> Gantt charts assist in this process by visually representing the project timeline, showing tasks, dependencies, and deadlines in a structured format. They help teams understand task sequences, allocate resources effectively, and monitor progress at a glance. By using Gantt charts, project managers can quickly adjust schedules, manage overlapping tasks, and ensure smooth workflow execution.
